In order to complete your check-in and training, you must arrive on site by the arrival time. In light of the fact that skydiving is weather-dependent, we suggest allowing all day for your skydive experience.\r\n<h5>SPECTATORS<\/h5>\r\nWe love having your supporters on-site to cheer you on, but when should they arrive for your skydive? It is suggested they arrive on site no later than 45 minutes after your arrival time. While you wait for you to take the leap, take advantage of our indoor and outdoor seating areas and caf\u00e9 serving hot and cold food and beverages.\r\n<h5>WHILE ON-SITE \u2013 WHAT WILL YOUR DAY LOOK LIKE?<\/h5>\r\nOur Customer Experience Team will welcome you and direct you to the Check-In room once you arrive on site. Here you will complete all your paperwork digitally, so be sure to keep your Check-In ID handy (found on confirmation texts and emails). You should plan to spend between 3-5 hours here with us, but be prepared that the experience may take all day due to the weather.\r\n\r\nA Customer Experience Team member will guide you through the process of your day in your induction. They will explain what will happen and when. Make sure you stay hydrated and eat during your time onsite.","reviews":[69829,69826,69827,69824],"locations":[69070,69075],"banner_image":69765,"banner_title":"Capture<br>Your<br>Day","banner_badge":"Prices Start from \u00a3119","banner_text":"We know just how important sharing this momentous event with friends and family is so have put together some different options for you.
