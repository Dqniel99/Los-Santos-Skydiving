Also special thank you\u2019s to Roman and Chris, who was Morwenna\u2019s instructor, for the amazing footage they captured of both the skydive and the proposal afterwards, again both great people to have had involved in the whole experience, plus the video editor(s) for pulling it all together into a great reel. Finally a thank you to the guy on the ground whose name I didn\u2019t get unfortunately for being on hand with the ring as soon as we landed meaning I was able to get myself ready for Morwenna\u2019s landing!&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/staging.goskydive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/HANDCAM-GH019782-1-841-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Kamil and his instructor Mark\" class=\"wp-image-70904\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Please pass on my thanks to all the people involved, I can\u2019t speak highly enough of the whole team and will definitely be recommending you to other people, and while we\u2019re starting to plan our wedding, I\u2019m also already planning my 2<sup>nd<\/sup>&nbsp;skydive with you which I\u2019ll be able to enjoy even more without the added nervousness of a proposal afterwards, absolutely loved the first one!&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/staging.goskydive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/HANDCAM-GH014487-1-960-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Chris and Morwenna\" class=\"wp-image-70905\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Want the GoSkydive Team&#8217;s help &#8211; <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.goskydive.com\/how-to-plan-epic-skydive-marriage-proposal\/\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/www.goskydive.com\/how-to-plan-epic-skydive-marriage-<\/a>  give us a call on 01722 442967 and our team will help you plan the big moment!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The experience of skydiving will always remain one of your most treasured and memorable firsts, so it will also make a perfect proposal idea.
