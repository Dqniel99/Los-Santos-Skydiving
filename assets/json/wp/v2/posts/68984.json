Within about 8-12 minutes, you will reach jumping altitude, where you can see a scenic view of the historical Wiltshire countryside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will freefall from a maximum altitude of either 10,000 or 15,000 ft. Reaching a velocity of 125mph, you will quickly rush to the Earth in either 30 or 60 seconds (depending on the aforementioned altitudes).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/www.goskydive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/HANDCAM-GH011002-1-1380-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-78704\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.goskydive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/HANDCAM-GH011002-1-1380-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.goskydive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/HANDCAM-GH011002-1-1380-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.goskydive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/HANDCAM-GH011002-1-1380-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.goskydive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/HANDCAM-GH011002-1-1380-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.goskydive.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/HANDCAM-GH011002-1-1380.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of our past jumpers have described our skydiving experience as being transported to another world.
